Great question! Let’s break down the **`throw`** and **`throws`** keywords in Java, what they do, and how they differ from **`try-catch`** blocks.

---

## 1️⃣ `throw` Keyword

* **Purpose:** To *explicitly throw* (raise) an exception from your code.
* **Usage:** You use `throw` when you want to create and throw a specific exception object **manually**.
* **Example:**

  ```java
  if (age < 18) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age must be 18 or older");
  }
  ```
* This immediately stops normal execution and passes the exception up the call stack unless caught.

---

## 2️⃣ `throws` Keyword

* **Purpose:** To **declare** that a method *might throw* one or more exceptions.
* **Usage:** You put `throws` in a method signature to tell callers of that method: “Hey, you need to handle or declare these exceptions.”
* **Example:**

  ```java
  public void readFile(String filename) throws IOException {
      // code that might throw IOException
  }
  ```
* It doesn’t throw the exception itself; it just says *“this method might throw this exception”*.

## How are they different from `try-catch`?

| Feature      | `throw`                                  | `throws`                                     | `try-catch`                               |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| What it does | **Throws** an exception explicitly       | **Declares** exceptions a method might throw | **Handles** exceptions thrown by code     |
| Where used   | Inside method body                       | In method signature                          | Around code that might throw exceptions   |
| Effect       | Creates & passes exception up call stack | Warns caller to handle exceptions            | Catches and manages exceptions locally    |
| Example      | `throw new Exception();`                 | `void f() throws Exception`                  | `try { ... } catch (Exception e) { ... }` |

---

## Quick example putting it all together:

```java
public void validate(int age) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    if (age < 18) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age must be 18+"); // throw exception
    }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
        validate(16); // might throw IllegalArgumentException
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        System.out.println("Caught exception: " + e.getMessage()); // handle it here
    }
}
```

---

## Summary:

* **`throw`**: You **throw** an exception explicitly.
* **`throws`**: You **declare** that a method *may throw* certain exceptions.
* **`try-catch`**: You **handle** exceptions that occur during execution.

Want me to show examples in Kotlin or Python for comparison?


Great question!

**No, the exception class name declared in the method signature with `throws` does not have to be exactly the same as the exception you throw inside the method**, but it must cover all **checked exceptions** that the method can potentially throw (either directly or indirectly).

---

### Here’s what that means:

* The `throws` clause in the method signature **must declare all checked exceptions** that **can be thrown** from the method.
* The method can throw:

  * The exact exception declared in `throws`.
  * Any subclass of the declared exception.
* You **do not need** to declare unchecked exceptions (like `RuntimeException` or its subclasses).

---

### Example:

```java
// IOException is a checked exception
public void readFile() throws IOException {
    throw new FileNotFoundException("File not found");
}
```

* Here, `readFile` declares `throws IOException`.
* Inside, it throws `FileNotFoundException`, which is a **subclass** of `IOException`.
* This is **valid** because the declared exception `IOException` covers the thrown exception.

---

### What’s NOT allowed?

If you throw a checked exception that’s **not declared** or a **superclass not declared**, the compiler will give an error.

```java
public void example() throws IOException {
    throw new SQLException("Database error"); // ❌ SQLException not declared or covered by IOException
}
```

---

### Summary

| Case                                         | Allowed?      | Reason                |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| Throw subclass of declared exception         | ✅ Allowed     | Subclass is covered   |
| Throw exact declared exception               | ✅ Allowed     | Matches declaration   |
| Throw checked exception not declared         | ❌ Not allowed | Compiler error        |
| Throw unchecked exception (RuntimeException) | ✅ Allowed     | No declaration needed |

If you want, I can explain this with a code snippet or in Kotlin too!
